# DesktopDisplay_SonicDisc
This sketch provides a visual interface for the data produced by SonicDiskReader. Connect an arduino with a SonicDisc to the computer, and then open the processing sketch. Use the number keys to select the COM port for the arduino, and the output data from SonicDiskReader will be displayed in a ring.

The distance of each circle will be proportional to the distance from the SonicDisc
