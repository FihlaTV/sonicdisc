*I wasn't sure how to add this to the inital repo, so I put my stuff in this folder so as not to mess up however your stuff is organized.*

Stuff:

**SonicDiscReader_B** - this is pretty much identical to your original code, except the output is parsed to interact with my processing file

**SonDisk_Proc3** - this is a visual display of the outputs from sonicDiskReader_B written in processing3.

**EaglePCB** contains eagle PCB fabrication files
